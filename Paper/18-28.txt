1. The Youtube video recommend system
- Citation: 779
- Year: 2010
- Authors: James Davidson, Benjamin Liebald, Junning Liu, Palash Nandy, Taylor Van Vleet
- Method: Content-based recommended system (based on content that user insterest and selected before).
  + Generate top k video and then rank based on video content data (meta data, raw videos steam, title, description), user activity data (rating a video, like, subcript). And then rank that top k video.
- Data: youtube video data
- Evaluate: Better than when compare to "Top rated", "Most view" and "Top favorite".
